# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to all free mobile applications ("Apps") published by ALIAKSEI YURHEL, including but not limited to AFit, Minesweeper, ANotes (unless otherwise stated for a specific app).

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Apps.

If you choose to use my Apps, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Apps. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

### Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, while using my Apps, I may require you to provide certain information. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.

Some of my apps use the Google Drive API for cloud sync purposes. If you choose to do a sync, your data will be stored in your Google Drive storage. I don't have any access to it.

The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. Or, if you choose to do so, third-party services will be able to save information from apps (and that information will be accessible by them).

### Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

These Apps do not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of these Apps.

### Service Providers

I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

- To facilitate our Apps;

- To provide the Apps on our behalf;

- To perform Apps-related services; or

- To assist us in analyzing how our Apps are used.

I want to inform users of these Apps that these third parties have access to their Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

### Security

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Links to Other Sites

These Apps may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update the Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.

This policy is effective as of __2025-10-28__
