AFit Lite is the next-generation app that allows you to record your workouts🏋️ and has good statistics📈 to analyze your progress. You can also create your own statistics and simply add entries to it.

Compared to the previous-generation [AFit App](https://github.com/lestec-al/afit/), the application is almost a total rewrite with a new look and feel. Instead of Java with XML views UI, it is written in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose UI.

The basic features are almost the same compared to the previous-generation app.
